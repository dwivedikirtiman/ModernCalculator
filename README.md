- A fully modern calculator supporting almost all the required operations in day-to-day use !!

- The project has all the functionality that a functional calculator has, also the read-me file is not a very necessary step here as the project is a minor project and does not contain broad functionality that needs explanation. 

- To run this project, you can directly create a Java class named ModernCalculator and paste the code from here, or simply fork the repo. You can even download it and can open it in your favorite IDE, and run the ModerCaluclator.java file.

-You can have a look at the layout of the final created calculator as follows:-
