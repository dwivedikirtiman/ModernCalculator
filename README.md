- A fully modern calculator supporting almost all the required operations in day-to-day use !!

- There is nothing much in this project apart from calculator functionality, so the read-me file is not a necessary step here. That's why I'm putting this much short information in the read-me file.

- To run this project, you can directly create a Java class named ModernCalculator and paste the code from here, or simply fork the repo. You can even download it, and can open it in your favorite IDE, and run the ModerCaluclator.java file.

-You can have a look at the layout of the final created calculator as follows:-
